# calculator
This is the first version of the calculator project from The Odin Project Foundations curriculum.

You can either click on the buttons, or use the keyboard. Key mappings below:
Numbers: 0-9
Clear: C
Undo: Backspace
Equal: Enter
Dot: .

To improve:

The styling is for now intentionally kitschy, as I used the project to test some CSS features I was working on.

Known issues:

The last column control pads are a bit off compared to the rest
